### MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium

MUNGE (_MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium_) is an authentication service for creating
and validating user credentials.  It is designed to be highly scalable for
use in an HPC cluster environment.  It provides a portable API for encoding
the user's identity into a tamper-proof credential that can be obtained by an
untrusted client and forwarded by untrusted intermediaries within a security
realm.  Clients within this realm can create and validate credentials without
the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or platform-specific methods.
