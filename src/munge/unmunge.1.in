.SH NAME
unmunge \- MUNGE credential decoder

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unmunge
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBunmunge\fR program validates a MUNGE credential (e.g., one created
by the \fBmunge\fR program).
.PP
By default, the credential is read from stdin and the metadata and payload
are written to stdout.  When the metadata and payload are written to the
same stream, they are separated by a blank line.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "\-L, \-\-license"
Display license information.
.TP
.BI "\-V, \-\-version"
Display version information.
.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-input " path
Input the credential from the specified file.
.TP
.BI "\-n, \-\-no\-output"
Discard all output, both metadata and payload.
.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-metadata " path
Output metadata to the specified file.
.TP
.BI "\-o, \-\-output " path
Output the payload to the specified file.
.TP
.BI "\-k, \-\-keys " string
Specify a subset of metadata keys to output.  The keys are case-insensitive
and delimited by whitespace, commas, semicolons, or periods -- as long as
the string is treated as a single argument by the shell (e.g., enclosed
by quotes).  Invalid keys are ignored.  If a subset is not specified,
all available keys are selected by default.
.TP
.BI "\-K, \-\-list\-keys"
Display a list of metadata keys.
.TP
.BI "\-N, \-\-numeric"
Display metadata values numerically.  This omits conversions from IP addresses
to hostnames, seconds to date and time strings, UIDs to user names, GIDs
to group names, and cipher/mac/zip type lookups.
.TP
.BI "\-S, \-\-socket " path
Specify the local socket for connecting with \fBmunged\fR.

.SH "METADATA KEYS"
The following metadata keys are supported.
.TP
.B STATUS
The status of the credential decode operation.
.TP
.B ENCODE_HOST
The address of the host on which the credential was encoded.
.TP
.B ENCODE_TIME
The time at which the credential was encoded (according to the local clock
of the host that encoded it).
.TP
.B DECODE_TIME
The time at which the credential was decoded (according to the local clock
of the host that decoded it).
.TP
.B TTL
The time-to-live value (in seconds) placed within the credential.
.TP
.B CIPHER
The cipher type used to encode the credential.
.TP
.B MAC
The MAC type used to encode the credential.
.TP
.B ZIP
The compression type used to encode the credential.
.TP
.B UID
The user ID of the process that encoded the credential.
.TP
.B GID
The group ID of the process that encoded the credential.
.TP
.B UID_RESTRICTION
The user ID restriction placed within the credential.
.TP
.B GID_RESTRICTION
The group ID restriction placed within the credential.
.TP
.B LENGTH
The length (in bytes) of the payload.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The \fBunmunge\fR program returns an exit code corresponding to the return
code of \fBmunge_decode\fR().  On success, it returns a zero exit code
which signifies the credential is valid.  On error, it prints an error
message to stderr and returns a non-zero exit code.
