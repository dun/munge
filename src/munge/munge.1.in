.SH NAME
munge \- MUNGE credential encoder

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B munge
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmunge\fR program creates an MUNGE credential containing the UID and
GID of the calling process.  Additional payload data can be encapsulated
in as well.  The returned credential can be passed to another process
which can validate its contents (e.g., via the \fBunmunge\fR program).
This allows an unrelated and potentially remote process to ascertain the
identity of the calling process.
.PP
By default, payload input is read from stdin and the credential is written
to stdout.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "\-L, \-\-license"
Display license information.
.TP
.BI "\-V, \-\-version"
Display version information.
.TP
.BI "\-n, \-\-no\-input"
Discard all input for the payload.
.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-string " string
Input payload from the specified string.
.TP
.BI "\-i, \-\-input " path
Input payload from the specified file.
.TP
.BI "\-o, \-\-output " path
Output the credential to the specified file.
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-cipher " string
Specify the cipher type, either by name or number.
.TP
.BI "\-C, \-\-list\-ciphers"
Display a list of supported cipher types.
.TP
.BI "\-m, \-\-mac " string
Specify the MAC type, either by name or number.
.TP
.BI "\-M, \-\-list\-macs"
Display a list of supported MAC types.
.TP
.BI "\-z, \-\-zip " string
Specify the compression type, either by name or number.
.TP
.BI "\-Z, \-\-list\-zips"
Display a list of supported compression types.
.TP
.BI "\-u, \-\-restrict\-uid " uid
Specify the user name or UID allowed to decode the credential.  This will
be matched against the effective user ID of the process requesting the
credential decode.
.TP
.BI "\-U, \-\-uid " uid
Specify the user name or UID under which to request the credential.
This requires root privileges or the CAP_SETUID capability.
.TP
.BI "\-g, \-\-restrict\-gid " gid
Specify the group name or GID allowed to decode the credential.  This will
be matched against the effective group ID of the process requesting the
credential decode, as well as each supplementary group of which the effective
user ID of that process is a member.
.TP
.BI "\-G, \-\-gid " gid
Specify the group name or GID under which to request the credential.
This requires root privileges or the CAP_SETGID capability.
.TP
.BI "\-t, \-\-ttl " seconds
Specify the time-to-live (in seconds).  This controls how long the credential
is valid once it has been encoded.  A value of 0 selects the default TTL.
A value of \-1 selects the maximum allowed TTL.  Note that \fBmunged\fR
can impose a maximum allowable TTL for all credentials which may be smaller
than this value.
.TP
.BI "\-S, \-\-socket " path
Specify the local socket for connecting with \fBmunged\fR.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The \fBmunge\fR program returns a zero exit code when the credential is
successfully created and returned.  On error, it prints an error message
to stderr and returns a non-zero exit code.
