.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmunge_ctx_create\fR() function creates and returns a new MUNGE context,
or NULL on error.
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_copy\fR() function copies the context \fIctx\fR and returns
a new MUNGE context, or NULL on error.
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_destroy\fR() function destroys the context \fIctx\fR.
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_strerror\fR() function returns a descriptive text string
describing the MUNGE error number according to the context \fIctx\fR, or
NULL if no error condition exists.  This may provide a more detailed error
message than that returned by \fBmunge_strerror\fR().
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_get\fR() function gets the value for the option \fIopt\fR
associated with the MUNGE context \fIctx\fR, storing the result in the
subsequent pointer argument.  If the result is a string, that string should
not be freed or modified by the caller.
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_set\fR() function sets the value for the option \fIopt\fR
associated with the MUNGE context \fIctx\fR, using the value of the
subsequent argument.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The \fBmunge_ctx_create\fR() and \fBmunge_ctx_copy\fR() functions return
a newly allocated MUNGE context, or NULL on error.
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_strerror\fR() function returns a pointer to a NUL-terminated
constant text string, or NULL if no error condition exists.  This string
should not be freed or modified by the caller.
.PP
The \fBmunge_ctx_get\fR() and \fBmunge_ctx_set\fR() functions return
\fBEMUNGE_SUCCESS\fR on success, or a MUNGE error number otherwise.

.SH "CONTEXT OPTIONS"
The following context options can be queried via \fBmunge_ctx_get\fR() or
specified via \fBmunge_ctx_set\fR().  The type following each enumeration is
the variable type used for the subsequent argument in \fBmunge_ctx_set\fR(),
or the variable type of a pointer used for the subsequent argument in
\fBmunge_ctx_get\fR().
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_CIPHER_TYPE\fR , \fIint\fR
Get or set the cipher type (see \fBCIPHER TYPES\fR).
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_MAC_TYPE\fR , \fIint\fR

This option cannot be explicitly set.
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_ENCODE_TIME\fR , \fItime_t\fR
Get the time (in seconds since the epoch) at which the credential was encoded.
This option cannot be explicitly set.
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_DECODE_TIME\fR , \fItime_t\fR
Get the time (in seconds since the epoch) at which the credential was decoded.
This option cannot be explicitly set.
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_SOCKET\fR , \fIchar *\fR
Get or set the local domain socket for connecting with \fBmunged\fR, where the
\fIchar *\fR type is a NUL-terminated character string.  The string returned
by \fBmunge_ctx_get\fR() should not be freed or modified by the caller.
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_UID_RESTRICTION\fR , \fIuid_t\fR
Get or set the UID allowed to decode the credential (see \fBUID & GID
TYPES\fR).  This value will be matched against the effective user ID of
the process requesting the credential decode.
.TP
\fBMUNGE_OPT_GID_RESTRICTION\fR , \fIgid_t\fR
Get or set the GID allowed to decode the credential (see \fBUID & GID
TYPES\fR).  This value will be matched against the effective group ID of
the process requesting the credential decode, as well as each supplementary
group of which the effective user ID of that process is a member.

.SH "CIPHER TYPES"
Credentials can be encrypted using the secret key shared by all \fBmunged\fR
daemons within a security realm.  Anyone having access to this key can
use it to decrypt a credential, thereby bypassing any restrictions being
imposed by \fBmunged\fR.
.TP
.B MUNGE_CIPHER_NONE
Specify that encryption is to be disabled.
.TP
.B MUNGE_CIPHER_DEFAULT
Specify the default according to the \fBmunged\fR configuration.
.TP
.B MUNGE_CIPHER_BLOWFISH
Specify the Blowfish cipher designed by Bruce Schneier.  This cipher has a
64-bit block-size and a variable key length.  MUNGE uses it with a 128-bit
key in CBC mode.  It is a fast block cipher but suffers from a slow key
setup time.  Consequently, it underperforms when generating small credentials.
.TP
.B MUNGE_CIPHER_CAST5
Specify the CAST5 cipher designed by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares.
This cipher has a 64-bit block-size and a variable key length.  MUNGE uses
it with a 128-bit key in CBC mode.
.TP
.B MUNGE_CIPHER_AES128
Specify the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher, also known as Rijndael.
It was designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.  This cipher has a
128-bit block-size and a key length of 128, 192, or 256 bits.  MUNGE uses
it here with a 128-bit key in CBC mode.
.TP
.B MUNGE_CIPHER_AES256
Specify the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher, also known as Rijndael.
It was designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.  This cipher has a 128-bit
block-size and a key length of 128, 192, or 256 bits.  MUNGE uses it here
with a 256-bit key in CBC mode.  Currently, \fBMUNGE_CIPHER_AES256\fR
requires the use of \fBMUNGE_MAC_SHA256\fR.

.SH "MAC TYPES"
The message authentication code (MAC) is a required component of the
credential; consequently, it cannot be disabled.
.TP
.B MUNGE_MAC_DEFAULT
Specify the default according to the \fBmunged\fR configuration.
.TP
.B MUNGE_MAC_MD5
Specify the MD5 algorithm designed by Ron Rivest and published in 1991.
This algorithm has a 128-bit message digest.  In 2004, a successful
collision attack against MD5 was demonstrated.  In 2009, a theoretical
pre-image attack against MD5 was published.  Consequently, use of MD5 is
not recommended due to its lower security margin.
.TP
.B MUNGE_MAC_SHA1
Specify the SHA-1 algorithm designed by the National Security Agency and
published in 1995; this is the successor to the original Secure Hash Algorithm
(now called SHA-0) published in 1993.  This algorithm has a 160-bit message
digest.  In 2005, successful collision attacks were demonstrated against
SHA-1.  In 2017, a successful identical-prefix collision attack (SHAttered)
was announced.  In 2020, a successful chosen-prefix collision attack (SHA-1
is a Shambles) was announced.  Since a pre-image attack has not yet been
demonstrated, SHA-1 should still be safe to use within MUNGE; however,
use of a SHA-2 hash function (such as SHA-256 or SHA-512) should be preferred.
.TP
.B MUNGE_MAC_RIPEMD160
Specify the RIPEMD-160 (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest)
algorithm designed in Europe by Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart
Preneel, and published in 1996.  This algorithm has a 160-bit message digest.
It is somewhat less popular than SHA-1 and correspondingly less well studied.
While slower than SHA-1, it is believed to have a slightly better security
margin.
.TP
.B MUNGE_MAC_SHA256
Specify the SHA-256 algorithm designed by the National Security Agency and
published in 2002; this is one of the SHA-2 variants in the Secure Hash
Algorithm family.  This algorithm has a 256-bit message digest.  In 2006,
NIST began encouraging the use of the SHA-2 family of hash functions for
all new applications and protocols.
.TP
.B MUNGE_MAC_SHA512
Specify the SHA-512 algorithm designed by the National Security Agency and
published in 2002; this is one of the SHA-2 variants in the Secure Hash
Algorithm family.  This algorithm has a 512-bit message digest.  In 2006,
NIST began encouraging the use of the SHA-2 family of hash functions for
all new applications and protocols.

.SH "COMPRESSION TYPES"
If a compression type is specified, a payload-bearing credential will
be compressed accordingly.  However, if the resulting compressed data is
larger than the original uncompressed data, the uncompressed data will be
restored and compression will be disabled for that credential.
.TP
.B MUNGE_ZIP_NONE
Specify that compression is to be disabled.  This is the recommended setting
unless there is a payload of sufficient size to compress.
.TP
.B MUNGE_ZIP_DEFAULT
Specify the default according to the \fBmunged\fR configuration.
.TP
.B MUNGE_ZIP_BZLIB
Specify the bzip2 library developed by Julian Seward.  This is slower and
uses more memory, but generally gets better compression on larger payloads.
.TP
.B MUNGE_ZIP_ZLIB
Specify the zlib library developed by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.
This is faster and uses less memory, but gets pretty good compression
nonetheless.

.SH "TTL TYPES"
The time-to-live value specifies the number of seconds after the encode-time
that the credential is considered valid.  In addition to specifying an
integer value, the following types are available.
.TP
.B MUNGE_TTL_MAXIMUM
Specify the maximum allowed by the \fBmunged\fR configuration.
.TP
.B MUNGE_TTL_DEFAULT
Specify the default according to the \fBmunged\fR configuration.

.SH "UID & GID TYPES"
The UID and GID restrictions can be used to restrict the decoding of the
credential based on the effective user and group ID of the requesting process.
In addition to specifying an integer value, the following types are available.
.TP
.B MUNGE_UID_ANY
Specify that no UID restriction is to take effect; this is the default
behavior.
.TP
.B MUNGE_GID_ANY
Specify that no GID restriction is to take effect; this is the default
behavior.

.SH ERRORS
Refer to \fBmunge\fR(3) for a complete list of errors.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following example program illustrates the use of the MUNGE context to
query the location of the \fBmunged\fR domain socket.
.PP
.nf
#include <stdio.h>                      /* for printf() */
#include <stdlib.h>                     /* for exit() */
#include <munge.h>
.sp
int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    munge_ctx_t  ctx;
    munge_err_t  err;
    char        *str;
.sp
    if (!(ctx = munge_ctx_create ())) {
        fprintf (stderr, "ERROR: Unable to create MUNGE context\\n");
        exit (1);
    }
    err = munge_ctx_get (ctx, MUNGE_OPT_SOCKET, &str);
.sp
    if (err != EMUNGE_SUCCESS) {
        fprintf (stderr, "ERROR: %s\\n", munge_ctx_strerror (ctx));
        exit (1);
    }
    printf ("socket=%s\\n", str);
    /*
     *  Note that 'str' is not to be free()d since
     *    it points to a string within the 'ctx'.
     */
    munge_ctx_destroy (ctx);
    exit (0);
}
.fi

.SH NOTES
Abandoning a new or copied MUNGE context without destroying it will result
in a memory leak.
.PP
The context passed to \fBmunge_encode\fR() is treated read-only except
for the error message that is set when an error is returned.  The context
passed to \fBmunge_decode\fR() is set according to the context used to
encode the credential; however, on error, its settings may be in a state
which is invalid for encoding.  Consequently, separate contexts should be
used for encoding and decoding.
.PP
A context should not be shared between threads unless it is protected by a
mutex; however, a better alternative is to use a separate context (or two)
for each thread, either by creating a new one via \fBmunge_ctx_create\fR()
or copying an existing one via \fBmunge_ctx_copy\fR().
