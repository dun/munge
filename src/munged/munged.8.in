.SH NAME
munged \- MUNGE daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B munged
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmunged\fR daemon is responsible for authenticating local MUNGE
clients and servicing their credential encode & decode requests.
.PP
All \fBmunged\fR daemons within a security realm share a common key.
All hosts within this realm are expected to have common users/UIDs and
groups/GIDs.  The key is used to cryptographically protect the credentials;
it is created with the \fBmungekey\fR command.
.PP
When a credential is created, \fBmunged\fR embeds metadata within it
including the effective UID and GID of the requesting client (as determined
by \fBmunged\fR) and the current time (as determined by the local clock).
It then compresses the data, computes a message authentication code, encrypts
the data, and base64-encodes the result before returning the credential to
the client.
.PP
When a credential is validated, \fBmunged\fR first checks the message
authentication code to ensure the credential has not been subsequently
altered.  Next, it checks the embedded UID/GID restrictions to determine
whether the requesting client is allowed to decode it.  Then, it checks
the embedded encode time against the current time; if this difference
exceeds the embedded time-to-live, the credential has expired.  Finally,
it checks whether this credential has been previously decoded on this host;
if so, the credential has been replayed.  If all checks pass, the credential
metadata and payload are returned to the client.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "\-L, \-\-license"
Display license information.
.TP
.BI "\-V, \-\-version"
Display version information.
.TP
.BI "\-f, \-\-force"
Force the daemon to run if at all possible.  This overrides warnings for an
existing local domain socket, a lack of entropy for the PRNG, and insecure
file/directory permissions.  Use with caution as overriding these warnings
can affect security.
.TP
.BI "\-F, \-\-foreground"
Run the daemon in the foreground.
.TP
.BI "\-M, \-\-mlockall"
Lock all current and future pages in the virtual memory address space.
Access to locked pages will never be delayed by a page fault.  This can
improve performance and help the daemon remain responsive when the system
is under heavy memory pressure.  This typically requires root privileges
or the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability.
.TP
.BI "\-s, \-\-stop"
Stop the daemon bound to the socket and wait for it to shut down.  Use with
the \fB\-\-socket\fR option to target a daemon bound to a non-default
socket location.  This option exits with a zero status if the specified
daemon was successfully stopped, or a non-zero status otherwise.
.TP
.BI "\-S, \-\-socket " path
Specify the local domain socket for communicating with clients.
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-verbose"
Be verbose.
.TP
.BI "\-\-auth\-server\-dir " directory
Specify an alternate directory in which the daemon will create the pipe used
to authenticate clients.  The recommended permissions for this directory
are 0711.  This option is only valid on platforms where client authentication
is performed via a file-descriptor passing mechanism.
.TP
.BI "\-\-auth\-client\-dir " directory
Specify an alternate directory in which clients will create the file used
to authenticate themselves to the daemon.  The recommended permissions
for this directory are 1733.  This option is only valid on platforms where
client authentication is performed via a file-descriptor passing mechanism.
.TP
.BI "\-\-benchmark"
Disable recurring timers in order to reduce some noise while benchmarking.
This affects the PRNG entropy pool, supplementary group mapping, and
credential replay hash.  Do not enable this option when running in production.
.TP
.BI "\-\-group\-check\-mtime " boolean
Specify whether the modification time of \fI/etc/group\fR should be checked
before updating the supplementary group membership mapping.  If this value
is non-zero, the check will be enabled and the mapping will not be updated
unless the file has been modified since the last update.
.TP
.BI "\-\-group\-update\-time " seconds
Specify the number of seconds between updates to the supplementary group
membership mapping; this mapping is used when restricting credentials by GID.
A value of 0 causes it to be computed initially but never updated (unless
triggered by a \fBSIGHUP\fR).  A value of \-1 causes it to be disabled.
.TP
.BI "\-\-key\-file " path
Specify an alternate pathname to the key file.
.TP
.BI "\-\-log\-file " path
Specify an alternate pathname to the log file.
.TP
.BI "\-\-max\-ttl " integer
Specify the maximum allowable time-to-live value (in seconds) for a credential.
This setting has an upper-bound imposed by the hard-coded MUNGE_MAXIMUM_TTL
value.  Reducing it will limit the maximum growth of the credential replay
cache.  This is viable if clocks within the MUNGE realm can be kept in sync
with minimal skew.
.TP
.BI "\-\-num\-threads " integer
Specify the number of threads to spawn for processing credential requests.
.TP
.BI "\-\-origin " address
Specify the origin address that will be encoded into credential metadata.
This can be a hostname or IPv4 address; it can also be the name of a local
network interface, in which case the first IPv4 address found assigned to
that interface will be used.  The default value is the IPv4 address of the
hostname returned by \fBgethostname()\fR.  Failure to lookup the address will
result in an error; if overridden, the origin will be set to the null address.
.TP
.BI "\-\-pid\-file " path
Specify an alternate pathname for storing the Process ID of the daemon.
.TP
.BI "\-\-seed\-file " path
Specify an alternate pathname to the PRNG seed file.
.TP
.BI "\-\-syslog"
Redirect log messages to syslog when the daemon is running in the background.
.TP
.BI "\-\-trusted\-group " group
Specify the group name or GID of the "trusted group".  This is used for
permission checks on a directory hierarchy.  Directories with group write
permissions are allowed if they are owned by the trusted group (or the sticky
bit is set).

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Immediately update the supplementary group membership mapping instead of
waiting for the next scheduled update; this mapping is used when restricting
credentials by GID.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Terminate the daemon.

.\" .SH FILES

.SH NOTES
All clocks within a security realm must be kept in sync within the credential
time-to-live setting.
.PP
While \fBmunged\fR prevents a given credential from being decoded on a
particular host more than once, nothing prevents a credential from being
decoded on multiple hosts within the security realm before it expires.
