.TH MUNGEKEY 8 "@DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium"

.SH NAME
mungekey \- MUNGE key management utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mungekey
[\fB\-c\fR] [\fB\-b\fR \fIbits\fR] [\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-k\fR \fIkeyfile\fR]
[\fB\-K\fR \fIkeydir\fR] [\fB\-r\fR \fIrealm\fR]
[\fB\-v\fR]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmungekey\fR executable is the key management utility for MUNGE.
It should be run by the same user that starts the \fBmunged\fR daemon.
.PP
If no options are specified, \fBmungekey\fR will attempt to create a new
key using the default settings; this will fail if the default \fIrealm\fR's
keyfile already exists.
.PP
All hosts using MUNGE for authentication within an security domain must use
the same shared symmetric key for each \fIrealm\fR each host should have
access to; these keyfiles should be created on one host and then securely
copied to other hosts.
