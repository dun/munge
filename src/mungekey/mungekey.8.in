.TH MUNGEKEY 8 "@DATE@" "@PACKAGE@-@VERSION@" "MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium"

.SH NAME
mungekey \- MUNGE key management utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mungekey
[\fB\-c\fR] [\fB\-b\fR \fIbits\fR] [\fB\-f\fR] [\fB\-k\fR \fIkeyfile\fR]
[\fB\-v\fR]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmungekey\fR executable is the key management utility for MUNGE.
It should be run by the same user that starts the \fBmunged\fR daemon.
.PP
If no options are specified, \fBmungekey\fR will attempt to create a new
key using the default settings; this will fail if the keyfile already exists.
.PP
All \fBmunged\fR daemons within a security realm must use the same key.
In other words, all hosts within an administrative group (or cluster)
using MUNGE for authentication must use the same key; this keyfile can be
created on one host and then securely copied to all other hosts.
