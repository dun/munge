#******************************************************************************
#  SYNOPSIS:
#    X_AC_CHECK_PTHREADS
#
#  DESCRIPTION:
#    Check how to link against Pthreads.
#
#    Also define both _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE which may be needed when
#    linking against multithreaded code.  By defining them here, the define
#    goes into "config.h" which is the first include (in my code, at least).
#    For more information wrt _REENTRANT, refer to the LinuxThreads FAQ:
#      <http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads/faq.html#H>.
